# Power BI Dashboard
This section contains the Power BI dashboard that visualizes the social factors' influence on the Fragile States Index (FSI).

## Purpose
The dashboard explores how selected social factors—such as **security**, **public services**, **human rights**, and **demographic pressures**—influence the overall FSI, which measures state fragility. The aim is to visualize patterns and correlations of the fators related to the FSI.

## Structure
- **Scatter Plots**: Visualize the relationship between the average value of social factors and the FSI across countries.
- **Time Series Charts**: Show how specific factors evolve over time by country, highlighting trends and patterns.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Allows the comparison between stable and fragile countries using key social factors.
- **Pie Charts and Tables**: Present the composition of the FSI by social factor for selected countries.
.
## Usage
- Navigate through tabs like:
  - **What is the FSI?**
  - **What will we do?**
  - **FSI and factor by country and year**
  - **Do social factors influence the FSI?**
  - **Conclusion**
